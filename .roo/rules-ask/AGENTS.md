# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Documentation folder (doc/) contains HTML guides but is not part of the Next.js application
- Template is ported from HTML to Next.js with some structural differences not fully documented
- Data files in src/data/ drive all dynamic content but relationships aren't explicitly documented
- SCSS structure mirrors HTML template organization but with Next.js modifications
- Component categorization (homes/, pages/, common/) follows template-specific logic
- Asset paths use TypeScript path mapping that differs from standard Next.js conventions
