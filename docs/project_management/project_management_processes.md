# Project Management Processes for Maskom

## Overview
This document outlines the project management processes for the Maskom repository, covering development workflow, issue tracking, release management, and team collaboration practices.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
The Maskom project follows a GitFlow-inspired workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: Production-ready code only
2. **Feature Branches**: For new features and improvements
3. **Hotfix Branches**: For critical bug fixes in production
4. **Release Branches**: For preparing releases (when applicable)

### Creating New Features
1. Create an issue describing the feature
2. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
3. Implement the feature following coding standards
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Submit a pull request to `main` with proper description
6. Address review comments if any
7. Merge after approval

### Bug Fixes
1. Create an issue describing the bug
2. Create a branch from `main`: `git checkout -b bugfix/bug-description`
3. Fix the bug and add tests if needed
4. Submit a pull request to `main`
5. Merge after approval

## Issue Management

### Issue Creation Guidelines
- Use issue templates when available
- Provide clear, descriptive titles
- Include steps to reproduce for bug reports
- Add appropriate labels (priority, type, component)
- Assign to appropriate milestone if applicable
- Assign to team member if known

### Issue Triage Process
1. New issues are reviewed within 2 business days
2. Issues are labeled appropriately
3. Assignee is designated if clear
4. Priority is set based on impact
5. Duplicate issues are closed with reference to original

### Labels and Their Usage
- **Priority**: `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`
- **Status**: `triage`, `in-progress`, `review`, `blocked`, `wontfix`
- **Component**: `frontend`, `backend`, `testing`, `documentation`, `infrastructure`

## Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements
- Title follows conventional commit format
- Description includes issue being addressed
- All automated tests pass
- Code review completed and approved
- Branch is up-to-date with `main`

### Review Process
- PR creators should self-review before requesting reviews
- At least one team member must approve the PR
- Reviews should identify potential issues and improvements
- Reviewers should test functionality if possible
- PRs should not be merged by the author unless approved

### PR Close Process
- Link to related issue using "Closes #issue-number"
- Update documentation if needed
- Add release notes if applicable
- Clean up feature branch after merge

## Release Management

### Versioning
- Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features, non-breaking
- Patch: Bug fixes, security patches

### Release Process
1. Prepare release notes
2. Update version number in package.json
3. Create release branch
4. Perform final testing
5. Create GitHub release
6. Deploy to production
7. Update documentation if needed

## Team Collaboration

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Maintainers**: Review code, manage releases, set direction
- **Contributors**: Submit code, participate in reviews
- **Reviewers**: Review pull requests, ensure quality

### Communication Channels
- GitHub Issues: For tracking work items
- Pull Requests: For code review and discussion
- GitHub Discussions: For broader project discussions

### Decision Making
- Technical decisions are made collaboratively
- Major architectural changes require discussion
- Consensus is preferred, but maintainers can make final decisions when needed

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions/components
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- All tests must pass before merging

### Code Quality
- Follow established coding standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Maintain performance standards

### Security Practices
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review code for potential security vulnerabilities
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Follow secure coding practices

## Project Tracking

### GitHub Projects
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking progress
- Move issues through appropriate columns (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Regularly update status of assigned issues
- Use automation to keep board up-to-date

### Milestones
- Create milestones for major releases
- Assign issues to relevant milestones
- Track progress toward milestone completion
- Reassess milestones quarterly

## Onboarding New Team Members

### Getting Started
1. Read README.md and setup documentation
2. Review CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Familiarize with codebase structure
4. Set up development environment
5. Join communication channels
6. Review open issues to find good first contributions

### Training Materials
- Documentation in docs/ folder
- Code examples in the repository
- Past pull requests for reference

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Code quality scores
- Test coverage percentage
- Time to merge pull requests
- Number of open issues
- User satisfaction (when applicable)

### Reporting
- Monthly summary of activity
- Quarterly review of processes
- Annual assessment of tools and workflows

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issues
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement fix with minimal changes
3. Test thoroughly in isolated environment
4. Deploy immediately after review
5. Update team on changes made

### Repository Compromise
1. Notify all team members immediately
2. Change all access tokens and secrets
3. Review commit history for unauthorized changes
4. Implement additional security measures
5. Report to appropriate parties if needed

## Process Review and Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Review development velocity and blockers
- Quarterly: Assess and improve processes
- Annually: Comprehensive process review

### Continuous Improvement
- Collect feedback from team members
- Track pain points in current processes
- Pilot new tools and workflows
- Document lessons learned
