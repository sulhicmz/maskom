# ADR 0001: Worker Stack Selection for maskom.co.id

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires building a fast, secure, SEO-friendly website for maskom.co.id with edge deployment capabilities. The existing repository contains a Next.js application, but for optimal performance and scalability at the edge, we need a serverless solution compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

## Decision
We will use Cloudflare Workers with Hono framework for routing and a lightweight frontend stack (HTML/CSS/TypeScript) to build the website.

## Rationale
- **Performance**: Workers provide global edge deployment, reducing latency.
- **Security**: Built-in WAF, DDoS protection, and TLS.
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture handles traffic spikes automatically.
- **SEO**: Static generation with proper meta tags and sitemap.
- **Compatibility**: Hono is lightweight and compatible with Workers runtime.
- **Maintenance**: Simpler stack compared to full Next.js for this use case.

## Alternatives Considered
- Next.js with Vercel: Good for SSR, but not edge-native like Workers.
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS: Too basic for dynamic routing.
- Other Worker frameworks: itty-router is simpler, but Hono offers better TypeScript support.

## Consequences
- Migration from existing Next.js codebase if needed.
- Focus on static assets and minimal server-side logic.
- Use Wrangler for deployment and management.
