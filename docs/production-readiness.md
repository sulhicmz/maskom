## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Document the issue with screenshots/logs
   - Notify the development team
   - Assess impact to users

2. **Rollback Action**:
   - Deploy the previous stable version immediately
   - Verify the rollback worked
   - Monitor for any issues with rollback

3. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct incident review
   - Document root cause
   - Implement preventive measures

## Sign-off

Before marking the deployment as production-ready:
